# RetroDev
The RetroCade project provides open source emulated platform libraries.

## Goals
The goal for RetroDev is to create and maintain emulation libraries (known as platform libraries) for various gaming platforms. 

Where this differs to standard emulators is that these are libraries and not full applications. What we will provide is a fast cross platform library that can be implemented into a multitude of applicatons and run on various platforms.

If you are wanting to use these to play your favorite retro games then look at a project like our sister project [Cade](https://github.com/play-cade)

## Getting involved
As this project is quite early in it's life there is no formal contribution guide. However reach out through the [Github Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/dev-retro/discussions) to discuss options on getting involved.
